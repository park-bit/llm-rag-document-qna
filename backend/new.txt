Yep. That output is pure cursed text, not AI hallucination. Your pipeline is working, but you fed it binary garbage and it politely embedded chaos.

What actually happened (no sugarcoating)

You uploaded a PDF or non-text file

FAISS embedded that nonsense

Gemini tried to answer using demon language

So congrats, you built a RAG system that can talk to corrupted memory dumps. Very cyberpunk. Not useful.
